# APPNA-EEWS
Automatic P-wave Picker Next-gen Algorithm for Earthquake Early Warning System

## APPNA_Algorithm_Offline.m 
This is  a MATLAB implementation of the APPNA Algorithm for detecting P-wave arrivals from seismic signals in an offline processing mode. The algorithm processes seismic data files (*.dat),  and identifies P-wave onset.

### üìÇ Input & Output
#### Input
- Folder containing `.dat` files with raw seismic waveform data. For examples see the folder sample_input 
- Each file should be a single-column numeric array.
#### Output
A summary table saved as `pwave_summary_IQR_Weighted_MAD_RMS.csv`.
Columns include:
- Filename
- PwaveArrival_iqr (detected arrival time in seconds)
- Threshold_iqr (adaptive threshold used)
- NoiseLevel (calculated weighted MAD+RMS)
- Timestamp
  
### ‚ö° Usage
1.	Set file path in the script by updating the folder_path variable.
2.	Run the script. It will process all .dat files in the folder and save a summary .csv in the same folder.
3.	Optional: Uncomment the plotting section at the end of the script to visualize envelope, threshold, and detected P-wave arrival.
### üõ†Ô∏è Requirements
- MATLAB R2018a or later
- Signal Processing Toolbox
